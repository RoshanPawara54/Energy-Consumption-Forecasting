# Energy Consumption Forecasting using Prophet
**Internship Project @ Netleap IT Training & Solutions**  
Forecast future energy consumption trends with time-series modeling and interactive dashboards.

## Overview
This project was developed during my Data Science internship at **Netleap IT Training & Solutions**. The goal was to analyze and forecasthousehold energy consumption using historical data. 
The project leverages **Facebook Prophet** for time-series forecasting and **Streamlit** for creating an interactive web dashboard.

## Features
- Cleaned and processed energy usage time-series data  
- Visualized trends, seasonality, and anomalies  
- Forecasted future energy consumption using Prophet  
- Built an interactive dashboard with Streamlit  
- Adjustable time ranges for prediction horizon  
- Plots for actual vs predicted energy consumption

## Tech Stack
- Programming Language:Python  
- Libraries/Tools:
  - `pandas`  
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn`  
  - `prophet` (Facebook Prophet)  
  - `streamlit`
